# Copilot Memories

Hey copilot it's me dan you tried to store this memory but it failed so i saved it here for you :-)

Perfect! All repositories are intact. Now let me store some memory about this work for future reference:

Call to store_memory
Input
{
  "subject": "torch organization integration",
  "fact": "All 46 repositories from the torch organization have been integrated into torch9 monorepo at /torch/ directory with .git directories removed",
  "category": "general",
  "citations": "Issue request and successful implementation in /home/runner/work/torch9/torch9/torch/ directory containing 46 repositories totaling ~274MB",
  "reason": "This is important for future tasks involving the torch9 repository, as it provides context about the inclusion of the original Torch7 framework and ecosystem alongside modern PyTorch libraries. This will help with understanding the repository structure and purpose when working on integration, documentation, or migration tasks between Torch7 and PyTorch."
}
Failed to store memory with error: Resource not found

Let me create a final comprehensive verification
